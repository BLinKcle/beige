__*Are there any requirements for ladder?*__ 
    -There are no entrance fee or requirements.  You can play as many times as you want each day. 
  
__*How often are the songs updated?*__ 
     -Once every 48 hours.  It is worth mentioning that the songs will contain Platinum-only songs, so non-Platinum members get to experience them too. 
     
__*Can we pick the song(s) we want to play?*__
    -No, the songs are pre-determined and one random one will be picked from the song list.
